# This is a sample inventory file, to go along with the sample lxd provisioner.
#
# The inventory should be structured as follows:
# - Group 'servers':
#   Only a single server is supported. Its inventory name must be 'borgsrv'.
#   Set 'ansible_host' to its actual name/ip.
#   The following host variables should be set:
#   - backup_operator_account:
#     The user that owns the backup config for all clients, and will
#     initiate backups in day-to-day operations. Could be 'root'.
#   - config_directory:
#     The directory where the config files and scripts are stored.
#   - backup_directory:
#     The directory where all the backups will be stored.
#
# - Group 'clients':
#   One host entry for each machine to be backed up. Its inventory name
#   should be a short (but unique) nickname, which will be used for
#   various automatically created entities (e.g. user accounts on borgsrv).
#   Set 'ansible_host' to its actual name/ip.i
#   Set 'ansible_port' if its not the standard 22.
#   The following host variables should be set:
#   - volumes:
#     A list of separate backup "volumes" which might have different
#     backup schedules or retention policies etc. Each volume will be
#     stored in its own borg repository. A volume has a 'name' (an
#     identifier that must be unique across the server) and a 'paths'
#     setting (space-separated list of paths to be backed up into this
#     repository).
#   - deploy_borg (optional):
#     Boolean to control whether to deploy the borg binary or not.
#     Defaults to true.
#   - ssh_opts (optional):
#     To override the ssh options that the client uses to connect to
#     the server. E.g. for older machines, may need to be set to
#     "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no".
